# Modeling Methods with Python Tools

This repo houses a selected collection of modeling projects involving Python tools, which were originally deployed as instructional materials in higher education.
* The Jupyter notebook [matrix_text_data.ipynb](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_py/blob/main/matrix_text_data.ipynb) is a demo where document-term matrices are explored with visualizations and singular value decomposition.
* Lecture notes developed for an undergraduate Linear Algebra course are available in [Zombie Math](https://github.com/arielcintronarias/modeling_py/blob/main/assets/svd_notes.pdf)
* Singular value decomposition applied in low-rank approximations of image data is explored in this notebook []()
